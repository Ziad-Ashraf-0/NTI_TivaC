# TivaC Project with Port, SysTick, Interrupt Controller, DIO, Button, and LED Drivers

This repository contains a TivaC project developed using Keil µVision that includes various drivers and components for the Tiva C Series microcontroller. The project provides drivers for port manipulation, SysTick timer, interrupt controller, DIO (Digital Input/Output), button, and LED control. These drivers are based on a combination of post-configuration and linking-time build to ensure optimized performance.

## Introduction

This project is designed to serve as a starting point for developing applications on the Tiva C Series microcontroller using Keil µVision. It includes several key components and drivers:

- **Port Driver:** Provides functions for configuring and manipulating GPIO ports.
- **SysTick Driver:** Implements a system tick timer for timekeeping and timing operations.
- **Interrupt Controller:** Handles interrupt management and configuration.
- **DIO (Digital Input/Output) Driver:** Facilitates digital input and output operations on the microcontroller's pins.
- **Button Driver:** Allows for easy interaction with push buttons.
- **LED Driver:** Facilitates control of LEDs connected to the Tiva C Series board.

These drivers are constructed by a combination of post-configuration and linking-time build to ensure optimized performance.
